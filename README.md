# Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-for-Predicting-Car-Prices
## AIM:
To write a program to predict car prices using a linear regression model and test the assumptions for linear regression.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import libraries and read the car price dataset.
2.Define features (X) and target price (Y).
3.Split data into train/test and scale the features.
4.Train the Linear Regression model.
5.Predict test results and evaluate using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R².
6.Plot graphs to verify linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality. 

## Program:

```

## Output:
![simple linear regression model for predicting the marks scored](sam.png)


## Result:
Thus, the program to implement a linear regression model for predicting car prices is written and verified using Python programming, along with the testing of key assumptions for linear regression.
